## ![MEN Stack CRUD App Project - Project Requirements](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/men-stack-crud-app-project/project-requirements/assets/hero.png)

## Overview[](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/men-stack-crud-app-project/project-requirements/#overview)

For this project, you’ll build a Node/Express/MongoDB application with full CRUD. You get to decide what you want to build as long as it meets the technical requirements outlined below.

**_You will work individually on this project_**.

> ❗️ As a reminder, General Assembly has a zero-plagiarism policy. **_Your project’s code must be substantially yours_**. Do not copy code from similar projects or other sources. However, using code from the internet to accomplish generic tasks is okay - for example, a line of code that replaces a character at a specific position in a string.

## Evaluation[](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/men-stack-crud-app-project/project-requirements/#evaluation)

Upon completion of your presentation, your instructional team will evaluate your project.

-   Your instructors will be using the above guidelines to determine whether or not the project passes all of the minimum requirements.
-   If your instructors determine that the project does not meet the minimum requirements, you may be provided the opportunity to address the deficiencies identified and re-submit the project. However, be aware that **there is only a single opportunity to re-submit a project during the course**. Please reach out to your student success specialist if you have questions.
-   Immediately after your presentation, your instructors may provide you with feedback that will benefit your project and perhaps the projects of other students. The feedback given at this time is not formal feedback and does not indicate whether you passed or failed the project.
-   If there is a specific section of code that you would like an instructor to provide additional feedback on, please ask!
