# Meme Vault
A place for the memes. Your memes. The weird ones, the cursed ones, the ones that live rent-free in your brain. Meme Vault is your gateway to community-curated meme collections. Tag, rate, favorite, and share your humor with the world.

## What is this?

A fully functional MEN Stack CRUD app (MongoDB + Express + Node.js) that lets users:
	‚Ä¢	üñºÔ∏è Upload/Create, Collect and Share your best memes
	‚Ä¢	üè∑Ô∏è Tag them with moods like ‚Äúrelatable‚Äù or ‚Äúchaotic good‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	üí• Delete them when they stop being funny

All wrapped in a sweet, minimalist Bootstrap UI that makes your memes look as good as they probably don‚Äôt deserve. Be sure to check out Dark Mode for that home theater vibe.

# üî• Project Overview
Meme Vault is a full-stack content-sharing platform built with the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) and EJS. Users can sign up for a free account, post memes, explore community creations, and interact through favorites, tags, and (soon) ratings. It mixes classic CRUD (Create, Read, Updaet and Delete) features  with modern UX to create a playful yet structured app for all things meme.

I built Meme Vault to push my software development skills, blending authentication, session control, real-time data relationships, and responsive UI polish. It's the most complete project I've shipped to date.

This app was built based on requirements for the General Assembly Software Engineering Bootcamp. Here are the [Project Requirements  ‚ûù](https://github.com/shawnhank/meme-vault/blob/main/docs/MEN%20Stack%20CRUD%20App%20Project%20Requirements.md)

# üóÇ Project Structure
This project uses a standard MEN stack layout with some opinionated enhancements for clarity and reusability.
See: ~[Project Structure & Layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawnhank/meme-vault/refs/heads/main/docs/meme-vault-project-structure.md)~

# ‚ú® Creator Note
This app was a blast to build. It pulls together everything I‚Äôve learned in the bootcamp so far: from full-stack architecture to UI/UX polish and even AI-assisted creative assets. It‚Äôs my most complete and expressive work to date.
Thanks for checking it out ‚Äî feedback welcome!
