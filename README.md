# Meme Vault
A place for the memes. Your memes. The weird ones, the cursed ones, the ones that live rent-free in your brain. Meme Vault is your gateway to community-curated meme collections. Tag, rate, favorite, and share your humor with the world.

## What is this?

A fully functional MEN Stack CRUD app (MongoDB + Express + Node.js) that lets users:
	‚Ä¢	üñºÔ∏è Upload/Create, Collect and Share your best memes
	‚Ä¢	üè∑Ô∏è Tag them with moods like ‚Äúrelatable‚Äù or ‚Äúchaotic good‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	üí• Delete them when they stop being funny

All wrapped in a sweet, minimalist Bootstrap UI that makes your memes look as good as they probably don‚Äôt deserve. Be sure to check out Dark Mode for that home theater vibe.

# üî• Project Overview
Meme Vault is a full-stack content-sharing platform built with the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) and EJS. Users can sign up for a free account, post memes, explore community creations, and interact through favorites, tags, and (soon) ratings. It mixes classic CRUD (Create, Read, Updaet and Delete) features  with modern UX to create a playful yet structured app for all things meme.

I built Meme Vault to push my software development skills, blending authentication, session control, real-time data relationships, and responsive UI polish. It's the most complete project I've shipped to date.

This app was built based on requirements for the General Assembly Software Engineering Bootcamp. Here are the [Project Requirements  ‚ûù](https://github.com/shawnhank/meme-vault/blob/main/docs/MEN%20Stack%20CRUD%20App%20Project%20Requirements.md)

# üóÇ Project Structure
This project uses a standard MEN stack layout with some opinionated enhancements for clarity and reusability.
See: [Project Structure & Layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawnhank/meme-vault/refs/heads/main/docs/meme-vault-project-structure.md)

üß† Meme Vault ‚Äì Server-Side Architecture Overview

Meme Vault is a full-stack Node/Express application built on the **MEN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js)** with EJS for server-side rendering and session-based user authentication. The app is organized using a modular, MVC-inspired folder structure to support maintainability and feature scaling.

### üóÇÔ∏è App Structure Breakdown
* **server.js**: The central entry point. It configures middleware (like session, flash, method-override), connects to MongoDB, sets up global variables (res.locals), mounts all route files, and handles 404 fallbacks.
	
* **models/**: Contains all Mongoose schemas.
  * User stores account info and hashed passwords.
  * Meme is the core content model.
  * Favorite, Rating, Comment, and TagAssignment manage user interactions with memes.
  * Tag enables categorization and filtering.

* **controllers/**: Each feature has its own controller (e.g., memes.js, users.js, auth.js, favorites.js, tags.js, ratings.js, comments.js). Controllers handle logic like DB reads/writes, session checks, ownership validation, and view rendering.

* **routes/**: Mirrors the controller setup. Each route file defines RESTful routes and uses middleware like isLoggedIn or isOwner for access control.

* **middleware/**: Houses auth and ownership guards. isLoggedIn checks for a valid session; isOwner ensures users can only modify their own content. Additional utilities (e.g., add-user-to-req-and-locals.js) attach user data to all requests and templates.

* **views/**: Structured by feature (memes/, users/, auth/, partials/). Uses EJS templates for dynamic rendering. Partial files (_form.ejs, flash.ejs, header.ejs, etc.) provide reusable layout components.

* **public/**: Contains static files like CSS, client-side JS, and uploaded assets. The main stylesheet applies global styling using Bootstrap with optional overrides.

### üîÅ Request Flow Summary
1. A user visits a route (/memes, /login, etc.).
2. Express routes match the URL and invoke the relevant controller.
3. Middleware runs first (auth checks, session parsing).
4. Controllers query the database using Mongoose models.
5. Results are passed to a view (EJS) or returned as a redirect/response.
6. Views use partials to render content conditionally based on session and ownership.
7. Flash messages display success or error states across redirects.


# üîÑ Data Relationships
This project uses all three major relationship types:
* **One-to-One**: each user has one avatar seed
* **One-to-Many**: users create many memes
* **Many-to-Many** (via join models):
  * Memes ‚Üî Tags (through TagAssignment)
  * Memes ‚Üî Users (via Favorites)
  * (Future) Memes ‚Üî Ratings, Comments

‚†ÄSee: [Data Model Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawnhank/meme-vault/refs/heads/main/docs/meme-vault-data-models.png) and the [Add Meme Workflow Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawnhank/meme-vault/refs/heads/main/docs/add-meme-full-flow-diagram.png)

# üìä RESTful Routes + Access Control
Meme Vault uses standard RESTful conventions with method-override and ownership protection.
See: [Full Routes Map ‚ûù](https://github.com/shawnhank/meme-vault/blob/main/docs/meme-vault-restful-routes.md)

# üß™ Manual QA Checklist
This project was tested using a full scenario-based manual QA system:
* Auth flow (register, login, logout)
* CRUD on memes w/ success/failure flash
* Favorites UX + profile integration
* Tags display + tag-based filtering
* Ownership-based edit/delete protection
* User navigation + community view
* 404 handling and fallback behavior

# ‚ú® Creator Note
This app was a blast to build. It pulls together everything I‚Äôve learned in the bootcamp so far: from full-stack architecture to UI/UX polish and even AI-assisted creative assets. It‚Äôs my most complete and expressive work to date.
Thanks for checking it out ‚Äî feedback welcome!
